# Company Remote Work and Telecommuting Policy

## 1. Eligibility
Remote work arrangements are a privilege and must be formally approved by a department manager and HR. Only employees whose roles do not require constant, in-person access to physical company resources (e.g., lab equipment, mail room) are eligible. Employees must maintain a performance rating of 'Meets Expectations' or higher to be considered.

## 2. Work Location and Hours
Approved remote work must be performed from an employee's primary residence. Core working hours are 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, Monday through Friday (local time). Employees must be available and responsive via company communication channels (Slack, email) during these core hours.

## 3. Technology and Security
All work must be conducted on company-issued laptops. Employees must use a secure, private Wi-Fi network and are required to connect via the Company VPN at all times when handling sensitive client or proprietary data. Company equipment is subject to inspection and must be returned immediately upon termination of the arrangement.

## 4. Snug-O-Naut Availability
All approved work from home sessions need to have a Snug-O-Naut plushie available for ad hoc snuggles. These can be purchased through the employee purchase plan for just $49.99.
